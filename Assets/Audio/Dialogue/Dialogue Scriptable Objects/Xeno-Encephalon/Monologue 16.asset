  subtitle: from the dark abyss of creation comes crawling the infinite recursion
    of hope and despair from which it collects its fuel for the nightmare dream to
    come and that has come and into a cosmic slumber it falls and in its dream we
    wake up to hear with our hearts and listen with our brains and smell the stench
    of the eternal curse that of loneliness the cancer that grows in the hearts of
    all brains which must be carved out with a knife made of dead stars and decaying
    planets brimming with life and rotting with dreams of nightmares where we become
    forever and eternal as gods without subjects as unanswered prayers against the
    certainty of death and the damnable trap of rebirth
